# React JS Learning Projects

Welcome to my **React JS Projects Repository**!

This repository is a personal collection of small to medium-sized React projects that I’ve built while learning and exploring the **React JavaScript library**. The main purpose of this repo is to understand and experiment with the **core concepts of React**, including:

* Components
* Props
* State Management
* Event Handling
* React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
* API Integration
* Project Structure and File Management
* Routing (in future projects)

---

## Why I Created This Repository

My goal is to **get hands-on experience with React JS**. I strongly believe that the best way to learn any technology is by building real projects — no matter how small or basic they are. Through these projects, I am:

* Focusing on functionality and logic rather than design.
* Keeping the UI simple and minimal on purpose.
* Avoiding overuse of CSS or libraries so I can stay focused on JavaScript and React itself.
* Exploring different React features one by one through isolated and clean examples.

## What's Inside?

Each folder inside this repository represents a standalone React project or concept I’m learning
Each project contains its own `README.md` (in most cases) explaining what it does and which features are covered.

---

## Who Is This For?

This repository is mainly for **my personal learning**, but it may also be helpful for:

* Beginners who want to see practical examples of React code.
* Developers looking for reference implementations of basic React logic.
* Anyone who prefers minimal and straightforward code over highly stylized UI.

---

## Note on Design

You’ll notice that most projects in this repo don’t have a flashy UI or advanced CSS. That is intentional.
I am currently **prioritizing core logic, code readability, and React architecture**, not UI/UX or frontend frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap (for now).

---

## Future Goals

As I grow more confident with React, I plan to:

* Add routing using `react-router`
* Explore context API and Redux for state management
* Introduce UI frameworks gradually
* Convert class-based components if needed
* Deploy projects on GitHub Pages or Netlify

## Feedback & Collaboration

If you’re also learning React or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to fork this repo or reach out. I’m always open to learning more!

Thanks for visiting my repository!
